## About Me

I received my B.Eng. in Automation from the Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University (ZJU) in 2020, and I am currently studying in the Master's programme of Systems, Control and Robotics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. My mentor during my Bachelor's study was Prof. [Chao Xu](https://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/xu) and my Bachelor's thesis was supervised by Associate Professor [Yu Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhangyu). I am currently doing my Master's thesis under the supervision of [Yuchao Li](https://yuchaotaigu.github.io/) and examined by Prof. [Jonas MÃ¥rtensson](https://www.kth.se/profile/jonas1). 

My research interests include automatic control, reinforcement learning, and their application to transportation systems.
