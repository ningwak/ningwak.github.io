## About Me

I received my B.Eng. in Automation from the Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University (ZJU) in 2020, and I am currently studying in the Master's programme of Systems, Control and Robotics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. My mentor during my Bachelor's study was Prof. [Chao Xu](https://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/xu) and my Bachelor's thesis was supervised by Associate Professor [Yu Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhangyu). I am currently doing my Master's thesis under the supervision of [Yuchao Li](https://yuchaotaigu.github.io/) and examined by Prof. [Jonas Mårtensson](https://www.kth.se/profile/jonas1). 

## Research Interests

My research interests include automatic control, reinforcement learning, and their application to transportation systems.

## Projects

- **Interaction Aware Decision Making for Automated Vehicles via Reinforcement Learning**
  <br>
  02/2022- (nearly finished) KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Master’s thesis
  <br>
  Based on the summer intern project, implement variants of the rollout algorithm for the decision-making task of the ego-vehicle in highway-env, compare the performance with the DQN baseline, and investigate the influence of base policy, horizon and look ahead steps on the decision-making performance.
  

- **Interactive Driving Behavior Prediction Based on Reinforcement Learning and Realistic Residual Block**
  <br>
  06/2021-08/2021 KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Digital Future Summer Intern Project
  <br>
  Improved the interactive behavior predictor based on Realistic Residual Block, transplanted it to the highway-env simulation environment and replaced the knowledge-driven model from the trajectory centerline generated by clustering from the existing trajectory data with the IDM+MOBIL model, so that it can be applied to unfamiliar environments. 
  <br>
 	Implemented the driving behavior decision-making system based on one and multistep lookahead rollout in the simulation environment.
